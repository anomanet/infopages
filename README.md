# infopages
<!-- this will be a website with easy to navigate docs including tons of manpages, infopages, and help menus for linux and powershell and command prompt eventually. I am using mint with some tools i will list. I have 3 tera bytes of drives space on an older desktop with 4 gb of ram and 2 dual core processors that i hope to host the files on to save cost.This will be a very large amount of files i look forward to learning the best ways to serve up this content as well as generate it in the terminal. I hope to build what i learn along the way into interactive tutorials for additional functionality to the website. What better than a web-browser contained playground and manpages all in one site!-->

<!--here is a sample on the home page for grep. i will update this daily as i work on this project.-->

**************

‘grep’ searches input files for lines containing a match to a given
pattern list.  When it finds a match in a line, it copies the line to
standard output (by default), or produces whatever other sort of output
you have requested with options.

   Though ‘grep’ expects to do the matching on text, it has no limits on
input line length other than available memory, and it can match
arbitrary characters within a line.  If the final byte of an input file
is not a newline, ‘grep’ silently supplies one.  Since newline is also a
separator for the list of patterns, there is no way to match newline
characters in a text.
